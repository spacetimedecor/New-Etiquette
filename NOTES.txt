Levels system:

rather than changing node sizes, the simplest way seems to be to have
the same sized nodes far back behind the closer ones? Then we can keep the
camera zoom etc as it is and just animate its location on the z-axis.

On the contrary, maybe it'd be simpler to keep everything on one plane,
and just change the zoom like a normal boy.
